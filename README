ReadyMedia-transcode
------------------
readymedia-transcode is a personal development branch of ReadyMedia (formerly known as MiniDLNA)
created by Lukas Jirkovsky for implementing transcode capabilities
in MiniDLNA.

It contains parts of the transcode patch originally presented
by the user Hiero at:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3193201&group_id=243163&atid=1121518

The transcoding work can be found in the "transcode" branch

General note about transcoding
==============================
Before using transcoding functionality of ReadyMedia-transcode, it needs
to be configured in the minidlna.conf.

In this file you specify which files needs to be transcoded
by specifying audio/video codecs, containers or extensions (for images)
and transcoders that are used for transcoding such files.

More detailed description is provided in the minidlna.conf file at
appropriate places. Example transcoding scripts are provided in
the transcodescripts directory in the ReadyMedia-transcode sources.

Note on RAW image transcoding:
==============================
ReadyMedia-transcode uses ImageMagick to obtain necessary information
about image files. ImageMagick uses so-called delegates for files
that ImageMagick cannot open directly.

For processing camera RAW format, it uses ufraw-batch delegate by
default. However, the ufraw-batch is very slow and it may take a few
seconds to process _one_ image.

To speed up the processing considerably, it is possible to alter
the delegate to extract only the embedded preview instead of doing
full processing of the RAW image. To do that, change the dng:decode
delegate in the ImageMagick's delegates.xml to following:

<delegate decode="dng:decode" command="&quot;ufraw-batch&quot; --silent --create-id=also --embedded-image &quot;--output=%u.png&quot; &quot;%i&quot;"/>
